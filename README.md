# BiS_Solver_GUI
GUI wrapper for kanetw's BiS solver

Requires [KaneTW's BiS Solver](https://github.com/KaneTW/FFXIVBisSolver) (of course?).

For now, you'll need to copy the SaintCoinach.History.zip file from the FFXIVBisSolverCLI directory into the application directory, or it'll crash when you attempt to use the item picker.
